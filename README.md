First Attempt at an efficient Grade Calculator for CISC 3130 course.

My main goal for this program was to get the input for the amount of points earned straight from the user. In my program, I created values for the 4 catgories, practice problems, labs, midterms, and the final exam. 

After the user inputs the amount of points they have for the category thus far, it prints that value out of the total number of points for the category.
For example, if a user inputs that they have earned a total of 34 points for the practice problems thus far, then it will print that they have earned 34/44 points for this category. 

Once the user inputs their values for the 4 categories, the program adds it all up and gives the user the total amount of points that they have out of 100, the max amount of points one can earn in the course. Not only this, but depending on the final value, the user will recieve their letter grade for the course as well. 

NOTE: There were a few things that I attempted to consider. For one, user experience. The program is very straight forward in calculating the totals. I considered asking the user for the amount of points that they earned for each individual practice problem assignment but that will make the program more prone to error and waste the user a considerable amount of time. Since individually we are aware of the total number of points we have for each section, its easier to calculate the total. 
Still this is something I will continue to consider implementing in the future in order to make it more efficeient and user friendly. 

Things to add in the future (personal notes):
  -GUI interface  (that is visually appealing and efficient)
  -Better data storing management
  -Amount of points necessary to reach the next letter grade
